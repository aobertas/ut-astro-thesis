``I am the very model of a scientist salarian, I've studied species Turian, Asari and Batarian. I'm quite good at genetics as a subset of biology because I am an expert which I know is a tautology! My xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian, I am the very model of a scientist salarian!"

% I copy/pasted then adapted this paragraph from Adiv Paradise's thesis. He believes he got it from Natalie Price-Jones's thesis
\textit{A version of the following chapter was originally published in the September 2017 issue of Icarus, Volume 293 as \citet{2017Icar..293...52O}. The co-authors were Christa van Laerhoven (who was my supervisor for the project, overseen by Norm Murray) and Daniel Tamayo. In this chapter, I explore how the dynamical spacing between orbits in evenly-spaced five-planet systems affects the system's instability timescale. In particular, I explore how a set of systems with a high-density distribution in spacing reveals additional structure on top of the instability-spacing relationship. This leads to the hypothesis that interacting mean motion resonances of multiple pairs of planets are responsible for the dynamics of such systems, and ultimately driving the instability.}
