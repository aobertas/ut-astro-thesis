% from archive info: "Boolean flag indicating if the planet induces transit timing variations on the orbit of another another planet in the system (1=yes, 0=no)"
% how have 24 planets been detected via TTVs but only 11 induce TTVs?????
% 304 have ttv flag
% "Flag indicating if the planet orbit exhibits transit timing variations from another planet in the system (1=yes, 0=no). Note: Non-transiting planets discovered via the transit timing variations of another planet in the system will not have their TTV flag set, since they do not themselves demonstrate TTVs."
% how many total then???
