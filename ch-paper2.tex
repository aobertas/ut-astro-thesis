\textit{A version of the following chapter has been accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and a preprint version of the article is posted on the arxiv as \citet{2023arXiv230612967O}. The co-authors were Daniel Tamayo and Norm Murray. In this chapter, I re-visit the dynamical packing of the Kepler multi-planet systems, with an order-of-magnitude more planets in multi-planet systems available compared to previous studies. In particular, I use \texttt{SPOCK} to examine the stability of over 9 million different orbital configurations after an additional planet has been inserted between an observed adjacent pair and reduce this data down to two different summary metrics corresponding to two different frameworks of planet formation. I find that dynamical packing increases with a system's observed planet multiplicity, which is consistent with dynamical sculpting throughout system evolution or with lower multiplicity systems having a higher likelihood of unseen planets.}

MNRAS papers require a data availability statement and I opted to retain it.
